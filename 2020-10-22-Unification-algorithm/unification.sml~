(*
1. unify : telescope -> (term, term) -> option telescope. Given a telescope σ and terms s and t, it computes an extension σ₀ of σ (if possible) that unifies s[σ] and t[σ]. Recall our notation that s[σ] is the term obtained by substituting all the variable assignments of σ in s.

(*
2. unifyList : telescope -> (term, term) list -> option telescope. This function simultaneously unifies each of the terms under the given telescope.
